# Overview

This website is capable of taking in text and image input and turning that into a sort of album to view a group of images.

This is useful for anyone who wants to display their work in a clean and organized method.

# Web Page

The main.html file references the script which is located in index.js.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode to write everything.

I used HTML, CSS, and javascript using the node library.

# Future Work

I can make the page look a lot better with more advanced styling techniques and fancier graphics.

* A color selector for the backdrop
* Some kind of framing on images
* More input parameters
